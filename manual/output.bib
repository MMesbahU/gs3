  abstract = {Recently, the use of linkage disequilibrium (LD) to locate genes which
	affect quantitative traits (QTL) has received an increasing interest,
	but the plausibility of. ne mapping using linkage disequilibrium
	techniques for QTL has not been well studied. The main objectives
	of this work were to (1) measure the extent and pattern of LD between
	a putative QTL and nearby markers in finite populations and (2) investigate
	the usefulness of LD in. ne mapping QTL in simulated populations
	using a dense map of multiallelic or biallelic marker loci. The test
	of association between a marker and QTL and the power of the test
	were calculated based on single-marker regression analysis. The results
	show the presence of substantial linkage disequilibrium with closely
	linked marker loci after 100 to 200 generations of random mating.
	Although the power to test the association with a frequent QTL of
	large effect was satisfactory, the power was low for the QTL with
	a small effect and/or low frequency. More powerful, multi-locus methods
	may be required to map low frequent QTL with small genetic effects,
	as well as combining both linkage and linkage disequilibrium information.
	The results also showed that multiallelic markers are more useful
	than biallelic markers to detect linkage disequilibrium and association
	at an equal distance.}

  abstract = {The first national single-step, full-information (phenotype, pedigree,
	and marker genotype) genetic evaluation was developed for final score
	of US Holsteins. Data included final scores recorded from 1955 to
	2009 for 6,232,548 Holsteins cows. BovineSNP50 (Illumina, San Diego,
	CA) genotypes from the Cooperative Dairy DNA Repository (Beltsville,
	MD) were available for 6,508 bulls. Three analyses used a repeatability
	animal model as currently used for the national US evaluation. The
	first 2 analyses used final scores recorded up to 2004. The first
	analysis used only a pedigree-based relationship matrix. The second
	analysis used a relationship matrix based on both pedigree and genomic
	information (single-step approach). The third analysis used the complete
	data set and only the pedigree-based relationship matrix. The fourth
	analysis used predictions from the first analysis (final scores up
	to 2004 and only a pedigree-based relationship matrix) and prediction
	using a genomic based matrix to obtain genetic evaluation (multiple-step
	approach). Different allele frequencies were tested in construction
	of the genomic relationship matrix. Coefficients of determination
	between predictions of young bulls from parent average, single-step,
	and multiple-step approaches and their 2009 daughter deviations were
	0.24, 0.37 to 0.41, and 0.40, respectively. The highest coefficient
	of determination for a single-step approach was observed when using
	a genomic relationship matrix with assumed allele frequencies of
	0.5. Coefficients for regression of 2009 daughter deviations on parent-average,
	single-step, and multiple-step predictions were 0.76, 0.68 to 0.79,
	and 0.86, respectively, which indicated some inflation of predictions.
	The single-step regression coefficient could be increased up to 0.92
	by scaling differences between the genomic and pedigree-based relationship
	matrices with little loss in accuracy of prediction. One complete
	evaluation took about 2h of computing time and 2.7 gigabytes of memory.
	Computing times for single-step analyses were slightly longer (2\%)
	than for pedigree-based analysis. A national single-step genetic
	evaluation with the pedigree relationship matrix augmented with genomic
	information provided genomic predictions with accuracy and bias comparable
	to multiple-step procedures and could account for any population
	or data structure. Advantages of single-step evaluations should increase
	in the future when animals are pre-selected on genotypes.},

	The results based on the genealogical information were conditioned

	overall results suggest that no great negative effect on genetic

	strategies against scrapie susceptibility based on the use of some
	ARR heterozygous males was difficult because the genetic relationships
	estimated among animals differed when pedigree or molecular information

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Feasibility of genotyping of hundreds and thousands of
	single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in thousands of study subjects
	have triggered the need for fast, powerful, and reliable methods
	for genome-wide association analysis. Here we consider a situation
	when study participants are genetically related (e.g. due to systematic
	sampling of families or because a study was performed in a genetically
	isolated population). Of the available methods that account for relatedness,
	the Measured Genotype (MG) approach is considered the 'gold standard'.
	However, MG is not efficient with respect to time taken for the analysis
	of genome-wide data. In this context we proposed a fast two-step
	method called Genome-wide Association using Mixed Model and Regression
	(GRAMMAR) for the analysis of pedigree-based quantitative traits.
	This method certainly overcomes the drawback of time limitation of
	the measured genotype (MG) approach, but pays in power. One of the
	major drawbacks of both MG and GRAMMAR, is that they crucially depend
	on the availability of complete and correct pedigree data, which
	is rarely available. METHODOLOGY: In this study we first explore
	type 1 error and relative power of MG, GRAMMAR, and Genomic Control
	(GC) approaches for genetic association analysis. Secondly, we propose
	an extension to GRAMMAR i.e. GRAMMAR-GC. Finally, we propose application
	of GRAMMAR-GC using the kinship matrix estimated through genomic
	marker data, instead of (possibly missing and/or incorrect) genealogy.
	CONCLUSION: Through simulations we show that MG approach maintains
	high power across a range of heritabilities and possible pedigree
	structures, and always outperforms other contemporary methods. We
	also show that the power of our proposed GRAMMAR-GC approaches to
	that of the 'gold standard' MG for all models and pedigrees studied.
	We show that this method is both feasible and powerful and has correct
	type 1 error in the context of genome-wide association analysis in
	related individuals.},

	residual feed intake than for the genetic variants in total, although
	the distribution of promoter sequence motifs was not different. This

	across 29 bovine autosomes and the X chromosome) using genotypes
	of 887 Holstein bulls. The average level of /D'/ and r2 for markers
	40-60 kb apart was 0.72 and 0.20, respectively in Holstein cattle.
	However, a high degree of heterogeneity of LD was observed across
	the genome. The sample size and minor allele frequency had an effect
	on /D'/ estimates, however, r2 was not noticeably affected by these
	two factors. Syntenic LD was shown to be useful for verifying the
	physical location of SNPs. No differences in the extent of LD and
	decline of LD with distance were found between the intragenic and
	intergenic regions. CONCLUSIONS: A minimal sample size of 444 and
	55 animals is required for an accurate estimation of LD by /D'/ and
	r2, respectively. The use of only maternally inherited haplotypes
	is recommended for analyses of LD in populations consisting of large
	paternal half-sib families. Large heterogeneity in the pattern and
	the extent of LD in Holstein cattle was observed on both autosomes
	and the X chromosome. The extent of LD was higher on the X chromosome
	compared to the autosomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For many years gene mapping studies have been performed
	through linkage analyses based on pedigree data. Recently, linkage
	disequilibrium methods based on unrelated individuals have been advocated
	as powerful tools to refine estimates of gene location. Many strategies
	have been proposed to deal with simply inherited disease traits.
	However, locating quantitative trait loci is statistically more challenging
	and considerable research is needed to provide robust and computationally
	efficient methods. RESULTS: Under a three-locus Wright-Fisher model,
	we derived approximate expressions for the expected haplotype frequencies
	in a population. We considered haplotypes comprising one trait locus
	and two flanking markers. Using these theoretical expressions, we
	built a likelihood-maximization method, called HAPim, for estimating
	the location of a quantitative trait locus. For each postulated position,
	the method only requires information from the two flanking markers.
	Over a wide range of simulation scenarios it was found to be more
	accurate than a two-marker composite likelihood method. It also performed
	as well as identity by descent methods, whilst being valuable in
	a wider range of populations. CONCLUSION: Our method makes efficient
	use of marker information, and can be valuable for fine mapping purposes.
	Its performance is increased if multiallelic markers are available.
	Several improvements can be developed to account for more complex
	evolution scenarios or provide robust confidence intervals for the
	location estimates.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The use of genomic selection in breeding programs
	may increase the rate of genetic improvement, reduce the generation
	time, and provide higher accuracy of estimated breeding values (EBVs).
	A number of different methods have been developed for genomic prediction
	of breeding values, but many of them assume that all animals have
	been genotyped. In practice, not all animals are genotyped, and the
	methods have to be adapted to this situation. RESULTS: In this paper
	we provide an extension of a linear mixed model method for genomic
	prediction to the situation with non-genotyped animals. The model
	specifies that a breeding value is the sum of a genomic and a polygenic
	genetic random effect, where genomic genetic random effects are correlated
	with a genomic relationship matrix constructed from markers and the
	polygenic genetic random effects are correlated with the usual relationship
	matrix. The extension of the model to non-genotyped animals is made
	by using the pedigree to derive an extension of the genomic relationship
	matrix to non-genotyped animals. As a result, in the extended model
	the estimated breeding values are obtained by blending the information
	used to compute traditional EBVs and the information used to compute
	purely genomic EBVs. Parameters in the model are estimated using
	average information REML and estimated breeding values are best linear
	unbiased predictions (BLUPs). The method is illustrated using a simulated
	data set. CONCLUSIONS: The extension of the method to non-genotyped

	genotyped for 9,919 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) using the

	Four thousand eight hundred fifty-six of the 9,919 SNP were located
	to chromosomes in base-pairs and formed the basis for the analyses.
	The mean polymorphism information content of the SNP was 0.25. The
	SNP centimorgan position was interpolated from their base-pair position
	using a microsatellite framework map. Estimated breeding values were
	used as observations, and the following traits were analyzed: 305-d
	lactation milk, fat, and protein yield; somatic cell score; herd
	life; interval of calving to first service; and age at first service.
	The variance component linkage analysis detected 102 potential QTL,
	whereas LDRM analysis found 144 significant SNP associations after
	accounting for a 5\% false discovery rate. Twenty potential QTL and
	49 significant SNP associations were in close proximity to QTL cited
	in the literature. Both methods found significant regions on Bos

	for fat yield; BTA 1, 3, 16, and 28 for protein yield; BTA 2 and
	13 for calving to first service; and BTA 14 for age at first service.
	Both approaches were effective in detecting potential QTL with a
	dense SNP map. The LDRM was well suited for a first genome scan due
	to its approximately 8 times lower computational demands. Further
	fine mapping should be applied on the chromosomal regions of interest
	found in this study.},

	success, interval from lambing to insemination) is the result of
	environmental and genetic factors acting on 2 individuals: the male

	approach (called additive model) proposed for studying such traits
	assumes that the phenotype is linked to a purely additive combination,
	either on the observed scale for continuous traits or on some underlying
	scale for discrete traits, of environmental and genetic effects affecting
	the 2 individuals. Statistical models proposed for studying human
	fecundability generally consider reproduction outcomes as the product
	of hypothetical unobservable variables. Taking inspiration from these
	works, we propose a model (product threshold model) for studying
	a binary reproduction trait that supposes that the observed phenotype
	is the product of 2 unobserved phenotypes, 1 for each individual.
	We developed a Gibbs sampling algorithm for fitting a Bayesian product
	threshold model including additive genetic effects and showed by
	simulation that it is feasible and that it provides good estimates
	of the parameters. We showed that fitting an additive threshold model
	to data that are simulated under a product threshold model provides
	biased estimates, especially for individuals with high breeding values.
	A main advantage of the product threshold model is that, in contrast
	to the additive model, it provides distinct estimates of fixed effects
	affecting each of the 2 unobserved phenotypes.},

	The first 2 models were simple repeatability models studying fertility
	of one sex and ignoring any information of the other. Models 3 and
	4 took into account the information of the other sex by the inclusion
	of its random permanent environmental effect, whereas models 5 and

	genetic evaluation models of male and female fertility ignoring or

	of the Manech Tête Rousse breed recorded from 2000 to 2004 corresponding
	to 79,352 ewes and 963 rams. The pedigree file included 120,989 individuals.
	Variance component estimates from the different models were quite
	similar; heritabilities varied from 0.050 to 0.053 for female fertility
	and were near 0.003 for male fertility. Correlations among estimated
	breeding values in the same sex using different models were higher
	than 0.99. The genetic correlation between male and female fertility
	was not significantly different from 0. These results show that for

  abstract = {Several studies have shown that selection of purebreds for increased
	performance of their crossbred descendants under field conditions
	is hampered by low genetic correlations between purebred and commercial
	crossbred (CC) performance. Although this can be addressed by including
	phenotypic data from CC relatives for selection of purebreds through
	combined crossbred and purebred selection (CCPS), this also increases
	rates of inbreeding and requires comprehensive systems for collection
	of phenotypic data and pedigrees at the CC level. This study shows
	that both these limitations can be overcome with marker-assisted
	selection (MAS) by using estimates of the effects of markers on CC
	performance. To evaluate the potential benefits of CC-MAS, a model
	to incorporate marker information in selection strategies was developed
	based on selection index theory, which allows prediction of responses
	and rates of inbreeding by using standard deterministic selection
	theory. Assuming a genetic correlation between purebred and CC performance
	of 0.7 for a breeding program representing a terminal sire line in
	pigs, CC-MAS was shown to substantially increase rates of response
	and reduce rates of inbreeding compared with purebred selection and
	CCPS, with 60 CC half sibs available for each purebred selection
	candidate. When the accuracy of marker-based EBV was 0.6, CC-MAS
	resulted in 34 and 10\% greater responses in CC performance than
	purebred selection and CCPS. Corresponding rates of inbreeding were
	1.4\% per generation for CC-MAS, compared with 2.1\% for purebred
	selection and 3.0\% for CCPS. For marker-based EBV with an accuracy
	of 0.9, CC-MAS resulted in 75 and 43\% greater responses than purebred
	selection and CCPS, and further reduced rates of inbreeding to 1.0\%
	per generation. Selection on marker-based EBV derived from purebred
	phenotypes resulted in substantially less response in CC performance
	than in CC-MAS. In conclusion, effective use of MAS requires estimates
	of the effect on CC performance, and MAS based on such estimates
	enables more effective selection for CC performance without the need
	for extensive pedigree recording and while reducing rates of inbreeding.},

  abstract = {During the past few decades, advances in molecular genetics have led
	to the identification of multiple genes or genetic markers associated
	with genes that affect traits of interest in livestock, including
	genes for single-gene traits and QTL or genomic regions that affect
	quantitative traits. This has provided opportunities to enhance response
	to selection, in particular for traits that are difficult to improve
	by conventional selection (low heritability or traits for which measurement
	of phenotype is difficult, expensive, only possible late in life,
	or not possible on selection candidates). Examples of genetic tests
	that are available to or used in industry programs are documented
	and classified into causative mutations (direct markers), linked
	markers in population-wide linkage disequilibrium with the QTL (LD
	markers), and linked markers in population-wide equilibrium with
	the QTL (LE markers). In general, although molecular genetic information
	has been used in industry programs for several decades and is growing,
	the extent of use has not lived up to initial expectations. Most
	applications to date have been integrated in existing programs on
	an ad hoc basis. Direct markers are preferred for effective implementation
	of marker-assisted selection, followed by LD and LE markers, the
	latter requiring within-family analysis and selection. Ease of application
	and potential for extra-genetic gain is greatest for direct markers,
	followed by LD markers, but is antagonistic to ease of detection,
	which is greatest for LE markers. Although the success of these applications
	is difficult to assess, several have been hampered by logistical
	requirements, which are substantial, in particular for LE markers.
	Opportunities for the use of molecular information exist, but their
	successful implementation requires a comprehensive integrated strategy
	that is closely aligned with business goals. The current attitude
	toward marker-assisted selection is therefore one of cautious optimism.},

	the proportion of genetic variance explained by 4 QTL described in
	previous studies (these QTL are segregating on chromosomes 6, 14,
	20, and 26). Genotypes for 11 markers were available for 3,974 bulls

	undergoing MAS. The parameters were estimated for 4 QTL and 5 dairy
	traits: milk, fat and protein yields, and fat and protein percentages.
	The proportion of genetic variance explained by the QTL ranged from
	as low as 0.03 to 0.36\%. Both lack of marker informativity and poor
	monitoring of QTL transmission might limit the accuracy of estimation.
	The QTL explained a larger proportion of genetic variance for milk
	composition traits. The QTL on chromosome 14 and chromosomes 6 and
	20 have their largest influence on fat and protein percentages, respectively.
	The overall proportions of genetic variance explained by the QTL
	were 27.0, 30.7, 24.1, 48.2, and 33.6\% for milk, fat and protein
	yields, and fat and protein percentages, respectively. These results
	clearly indicated that a large part of the genetic variance is explained

  abstract = {Fertility quantitative trait loci (QTL) are of high interest in dairy
	cattle since insemination failure has dramatically increased in some
	breeds such as Holstein. High-throughput SNP analysis and SNP microarrays
	give the opportunity to genotype many animals for hundreds SNPs per
	chromosome. In this study, due to these techniques a dense SNP marker
	map was used to fine map a QTL underlying nonreturn rate measured
	90 days after artificial insemination previously detected with a
	low-density microsatellite marker map. A granddaughter design with
	17 Holstein half-sib families (926 offspring) was genotyped for a
	set of 437 SNPs mapping to BTA3. Linkage analysis was performed by
	both regression and variance components analysis. An additional analysis
	combining both linkage analysis and linkage-disequilibrium information
	was applied. This method first estimated identity-by-descent probabilities
	among base haplotypes. These probabilities were then used to group
	the base haplotypes in different clusters. A QTL explaining 14\%
	of the genetic variance was found with high significance (P < 0.001)
	at position 19 cM with the linkage analysis and four sires were estimated
	to be heterozygous (P < 0.05). Addition of linkage-disequilibrium
	information refined the QTL position to a set of narrow peaks. The
	use of the haplotypes of heterozygous sires offered the possibility
	to give confidence in some peaks while others could be discarded.
	Two peaks with high likelihood-ratio test values in the region of
	which heterozygous sires shared a common haplotype appeared particularly
	interesting. Despite the fact that the analysis did not fine map
	the QTL in a unique narrow region, the method proved to be able to
	handle efficiently and automatically a large amount of information
	and to refine the QTL position to a small set of narrow intervals.
	In addition, the QTL identified was confirmed to have a large effect
	(explaining 13.8\% of the genetic variance) on dairy cow fertility

	Four hundred and forty-seven sheep were identified as 'scrapie animals'.
	Several models, including level of exposure as a time-dependent effect,

	related to vertical transmission, were tested. The best model was
	extended to a sire-dam frailty model, in order to estimate the polygenic

	only sheep with a low degree of exposure to infection as lambs (lambs
	reared artificially and born out of a healthy dam) showed less risk
	than others. Animals first exposed to infection at older ages seemed
	to be less susceptible to scrapie. In this Romanov population, new

	high-resolution linkage disequilibrium mapping of quantitative trait
	loci (QTL). Two regression models, the genotype effect model and
	the additive effect model, are proposed to model the association
	between the markers and the trait locus. The marker can be either
	diallelic or multiallelic. If only one marker is used, the method
	is similar to a classical setting by Nielsen and Weir, and the additive
	effect model is equivalent to the haplotype trend regression (HTR)
	method by Zaykin et al. If two/multiple marker data with phase ambiguity
	are used in the analysis, the proposed models can be used to analyze
	the data directly. By analytical formulas, we show that the genotype
	effect model can be used to model the additive and dominance effects
	simultaneously; the additive effect model takes care of the additive
	effect only. On the basis of the two models, F-test statistics are
	proposed to test association between the QTL and markers. By a simulation
	study, we show that the two models have reasonable type I error rates
	for a data set of moderate sample size. The noncentrality parameter
	approximations of F-test statistics are derived to make power calculation
	and comparison. By a simulation study, it is found that the noncentrality
	parameter approximations of F-test statistics work very well. Using
	the noncentrality parameter approximations, we compare the power
	of the two models with that of the HTR. In addition, a simulation
	study is performed to make a comparison on the basis of the haplotype
	frequencies of 10 SNPs of angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) genes.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:The incorporation of genomic coefficients into the numerator
	relationship matrix allows estimation of breeding values using all
	phenotypic, pedigree and genomic information simultaneously. In such
	a single-step procedure, genomic and pedigree-based relationships
	have to be compatible. As there are many options to create genomic
	relationships, there is a question of which is optimal and what the
	effects of deviations from optimality are.METHODS:Data of litter
	size (total number born per litter) for 338,346 sows were analyzed.
	Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip genotypes were available for 1,989.
	Analyses were carried out with the complete data set and with a subset
	of genotyped animals and three generations pedigree (5,090 animals).
	A single-trait animal model was used to estimate variance components
	and breeding values. Genomic relationship matrices were constructed
	using allele frequencies equal to 0.5 (G05), equal to the average
	minor allele frequency (GMF), or equal to observed frequencies (GOF).
	A genomic matrix considering random ascertainment of allele frequencies
	was also used (GOF*). A normalized matrix (GN) was obtained to have
	average diagonal coefficients equal to 1. The genomic matrices were
	combined with the numerator relationship matrix creating H matrices.RESULTS:In
	G05 and GMF, both diagonal and off-diagonal elements were on average
	greater than the pedigree-based coefficients. In GOF and GOF*, the
	average diagonal elements were smaller than pedigree-based coefficients.
	The mean of off-diagonal coefficients was zero in GOF and GOF*. Choices
	of G with average diagonal coefficients different from 1 led to greater
	estimates of additive variance in the smaller data set. The correlation
	between EBV and genomic EBV (n = 1,989) were: 0.79 using G05, 0.79
	using GMF, 0.78 using GOF, 0.79 using GOF*, and 0.78 using GN. Accuracies
	calculated by inversion increased with all genomic matrices. The
	accuracies of genomic-assisted EBV were inflated in all cases except
	when GN was used.CONCLUSIONS:Parameter estimates may be biased if
	the genomic relationship coefficients are in a different scale than
	pedigree-based coefficients. A reasonable scaling may be obtained
	by using observed allele frequencies and re-scaling the genomic relationship
	matrix to obtain average diagonal elements of 1.},

	found to be more telomeric than the two QTLunderlying fat yield.
	Each identified QTL affecting milk fat yield was physically mapped

	for a quantitative trait. This paper considers prediction of breeding
	value based on a linear combination of the markers. In this case
	the best estimate of each marker's effect is the expectation of the
	effect conditional on the data. To calculate this requires a prior
	distribution of marker effects. If the marker effects are normally
	distributed with constant variance, BLUP can be used to calculate
	the estimated effects of the markers and hence the estimated breeding
	value (EBV). In this case the model is equivalent to a conventional
	animal model in which the relationship matrix among the animals is
	estimated from the markers instead of the pedigree. The accuracy
	of the EBV can approach 1.0 but a very large amount of data is required.
	An alternative model was investigated in which only some markers
	have non-zero effects and these effects follow a reflected exponential
	distribution. In this case the expected effect of a marker is a non-linear
	function of the data such that apparently small effects are regressed
	back almost to zero and consequently these markers can be deleted
	from the model. The accuracy in this case is considerably higher
	than when marker effects are normally distributed. If genomic selection
	is practiced for several generations the response declines in a manner
	that can be predicted from the marker allele frequencies. Genomic
	selection is likely to lead to a more rapid decline in the selection
	response than phenotypic selection unless new markers are continually
	added to the prediction of breeding value. A method to find the optimum
	index to maximise long term selection response is derived. This index
	varies the weight given to a marker according to its frequency such
	that markers where the favourable allele has low frequency receive
	more weight in the index.},

	will be knowledge of genes that can be used to select more profitable
	livestock. Although it is possible to use genetic markers linked
	to genes of economic importance, tests for the genes themselves will
	be much more successful. Consequently finding genes of economic importance
	to livestock will be a major research aim for the future. Most traits
	of economic importance are quantitative traits affected by many genes.
	Mutations at many genes (e.g. 500) and at many positions within a
	gene (e.g. 1000 coding and non-coding bases) can affect a typical
	quantitative trait. The effect of these mutations on phenotype is
	usually small (e.g. 0.1 standard deviation) but occasionally large.
	Many mutations are lost from the population through genetic drift
	and selection, so that polymorphisms exist at only a subset of the
	relevant genes (e.g. 100 genes). Finding these genes, that have relatively
	small effects, is more difficult than finding genes for a classical
	Mendellian trait but, as the genomic tools become more powerful,
	it is becoming feasible and some successes have already occurred.
	The standard approach is to map a quantitative trait loci (QTL) to
	a chromosome region using linkage and linkage disequilibrium. Then
	test polymorphisms in positional candidate genes for an effect on
	the trait. Tools such as genomic sequence, EST collections and comparative
	maps make this approach feasible. Candidate genes can be selected
	based on functional data such as gene expression obtained from microarrays.
	At present the gain in rate of genetic improvement from use of DNA-based
	tests for QTL is small, because selection without them is already
	quite accurate, not enough QTL have been identified and genotyping
	is too expensive. However, in the future, with many QTL identified
	and inexpensive genotyping combined with decreased generation intervals,
	large gains are possible.}

  abstract = {Data on a genetic marker linked to a gene affecting an important trait
	could help us to estimate breeding values for that triat more accurately.
	The accuracy is enhanced if many genetic markers are used and if
	important genes are bracketed by two markers. A mixed model for analysis
	of this type of data is presented. The model is appropriate for an
	arbitrary pedigree structure in an outbreeding species. It uses a
	relationship matrix among marked chromosome segments or QTL alleles.
	By using an analysis analogous to a reduced animal model, the number
	of effects to be estimated can be greatly reduced. A grouping strategy
	that can account for crossbreeding and linkage disequilibrium between
	markers and QTL alleles is included in the model. For analyses of
	a cross between inbred lines the model can be simplified. This simplification
	shows clearly the relationship of the mixed model analyses to multiple
	regression models used previously. The simplified model may also
	be useful for some experiments in outbreeding populations.}

	do not require knowledge of haplotypes, the mapping accuracy of regression
	in all populations was similar to or greater than that of the IBD-based

	to be sensitive to the number of linked markers that was included

	conditions. It was found that using haplotypes of 4 or 6 markers
	as a sliding window resulted in the greatest mapping accuracy under
	nearly all conditions, although the true IBD state at a putative
	QTL position was most accurately predicted by IBD probabilities obtained
	using all markers. Using 4 or 6 markers resulted in greater discrimination
	of IBD probabilities between positions while maintaining sufficient
	accuracy of IBD probabilities to detect the QTL. Fitting IBD probabilities
	on the basis of a single marker resulted in the worst mapping accuracy
	under all conditions because it resulted in poor accuracy of IBD
	probabilities. In conclusion, for fine mapping using IBD methods,
	marker information must be used in a manner that results in sensitivity
	of IBD probabilities to the putative position of the QTL while maintaining
	sufficient accuracy of IBD probabilities to detect the QTL. Contrary
	to expectation, use of haplotypes of 4-6 markers to derive IBD probabilities,
	rather than all available markers, best fits these criteria. Thus
	for populations similar to those simulated here, optimal mapping
	accuracy for this IBD-based fine-mapping method is obtained with
	a haplotype structure including a subset of all available markers.}

	a secondary goal is to estimate the phenotypic effects of each identified
	locus. Here, it is shown that these two objectives cannot be met
	reliably by use of a single data set of a currently realistic size.
	Simulation and analytical results, based on variance-components linkage
	analysis as an example, demonstrate that estimates of locus-specific
	effect size at genomewide LOD score peaks tend to be grossly inflated
	and can even be virtually independent of the true effect size, even
	for studies on large samples when the true effect size is small.
	However, the bias diminishes asymptotically. The explanation for
	the bias is that the LOD score is a function of the locus-specific
	effect-size estimate, such that there is a high correlation between
	the observed statistical significance and the effect-size estimate.
	When the LOD score is maximized over the many pointwise tests being
	conducted throughout the genome, the locus-specific effect-size estimate
	is therefore effectively maximized as well. We argue that attempts
	at bias correction give unsatisfactory results, and that pointwise
	estimation in an independent data set may be the only way of obtaining
	reliable estimates of locus-specific effect-and then only if one
	does not condition on statistical significance being obtained. We
	further show that the same factors causing this bias are responsible
	for frequent failures to replicate initial claims of linkage or association
	for complex traits, even when the initial localization is, in fact,
	correct. The findings of this study have wide-ranging implications,
	as they apply to all statistical methods of gene localization. It
	is hoped that, by keeping this bias in mind, we will more realistically
	interpret and extrapolate from the results of genomewide scans.},

	accuracies of GEBVs. Strategies to validate the accuracy of GEBVs
	due to LD are given. Simulations were used to show that accuracies
	of GEBVs obtained by fixed regression-least squares (FR-LS), random
	regression-best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP), and Bayes-B
	are nonzero even without LD. When LD was present, accuracies decrease
	rapidly in generations after estimation due to the decay of genetic
	relationships. However, there is a persistent accuracy due to LD,
	which can be estimated by modeling the decay of genetic relationships
	and the decay of LD. The impact of genetic relationships was greatest
	for RR-BLUP. The accuracy of GEBVs can result entirely from genetic
	relationships captured by markers, and to validate the potential
	of genomic selection, several generations have to be analyzed to
	estimate the accuracy due to LD. The method of choice was Bayes-B;
	FR-LS should be investigated further, whereas RR-BLUP cannot be recommended.},

  abstract = {The use of genetic maps based upon molecular markers has allowed the
	dissection of some of the factors underlying quantitative variation
	in crosses between inbred lines. For many species crossing inbred
	lines is not a practical proposition, although crosses between genetically
	very different outbred lines are possible. Here we develop a least
	squares method for the analysis of crosses between outbred lines
	which simultaneously uses information from multiple linked markers.
	The method is suitable for crosses where the lines may be segregating
	at marker loci but can be assumed to be fixed for alternative alleles
	at the major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting the traits
	under analysis (e.g., crosses between divergent selection lines or
	breeds with different selection histories). The simultaneous use
	of multiple markers from a linkage group increases the sensitivity
	of the test statistic, and thus the power for the detection of QTLs,
	compared to the use of single markers or markers flanking an interval.
	The gain is greater for more closely spaced markers and for markers
	of lower information content. Use of multiple markers can also remove
	the bias in the estimated position and effect of a QTL which may
	result when different markers in a linkage group vary in their heterozygosity
	in the F-1 (and thus in their information content) and are considered
	only singly or a pair at a time. The method is relatively simple
	to apply so that more complex models can be fitted than is currently
	possible by maximum likelihood. Thus fixed effects and effects of
	background genotype can be fitted simultaneously with the exploration
	of a single linkage group which will increase the power to detect
	QTLs by reducing the residual variance. More complex models with
	several QTLs in the same linkage group and two-locus interactions
	between QTLs can similarly be examined. Thus least squares provides
	a powerful tool to extend the range of crosses from which QTLs can
	be dissected whilst at the same time allowing flexible and realistic
	models to be explored.}

	approaches such as crossvalidation may help in this respect. Marker
	systems are now becoming available that allow the high density of

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two key findings from genomic selection experiments are
	1) the reference population used must be very large to subsequently
	predict accurate genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV), and 2)
	prediction equations derived in one breed do not predict accurate
	GEBV when applied to other breeds. Both findings are a problem for
	breeds where the number of individuals in the reference population
	is limited. A multi-breed reference population is a potential solution,
	and here we investigate the accuracies of GEBV in Holstein dairy
	cattle and Jersey dairy cattle when the reference population is single
	breed or multi-breed. The accuracies were obtained both as a function
	of elements of the inverse coefficient matrix and from the realised
	accuracies of GEBV. METHODS: Best linear unbiased prediction with
	a multi-breed genomic relationship matrix (GBLUP) and two Bayesian
	methods (BAYESA and BAYES_SSVS) which estimate individual SNP effects
	were used to predict GEBV for 400 and 77 young Holstein and Jersey
	bulls respectively, from a reference population of 781 and 287 Holstein
	and Jersey bulls, respectively. Genotypes of 39,048 SNP markers were
	used. Phenotypes in the reference population were de-regressed breeding
	values for production traits. For the GBLUP method, expected accuracies
	calculated from the diagonal of the inverse of coefficient matrix
	were compared to realised accuracies. RESULTS: When GBLUP was used,
	expected accuracies from a function of elements of the inverse coefficient
	matrix agreed reasonably well with realised accuracies calculated
	from the correlation between GEBV and EBV in single breed populations,
	but not in multi-breed populations. When the Bayesian methods were
	used, realised accuracies of GEBV were up to 13\% higher when the
	multi-breed reference population was used than when a pure breed
	reference was used. However no consistent increase in accuracy across
	traits was obtained. CONCLUSION: Predicting genomic breeding values
	using a genomic relationship matrix is an attractive approach to
	implement genomic selection as expected accuracies of GEBV can be
	readily derived. However in multi-breed populations, Bayesian approaches
	give higher accuracies for some traits. Finally, multi-breed reference
	populations will be a valuable resource to fine map QTL.},

  abstract = {A new technology called genomic selection is revolutionizing dairy
	cattle breeding. Genomic selection refers to selection decisions
	based on genomic breeding values (GEBV). The GEBV are calculated
	as the sum of the effects of dense genetic markers, or haplotypes
	of these markers, across the entire genome, thereby potentially capturing
	all the quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to variation
	in a trait. The QTL effects, inferred from either haplotypes or individual
	single nucleotide polymorphism markers, are first estimated in a
	large reference population with phenotypic information. In subsequent
	generations, only marker information is required to calculate GEBV.
	The reliability of GEBV predicted in this way has already been evaluated
	in experiments in the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and
	the Netherlands. These experiments used reference populations of
	between 650 and 4,500 progeny-tested Holstein-Friesian bulls, genotyped
	for approximately 50,000 genome-wide markers. Reliabilities of GEBV
	for young bulls without progeny test results in the reference population
	were between 20 and 67\%. The reliability achieved depended on the
	heritability of the trait evaluated, the number of bulls in the reference
	population, the statistical method used to estimate the single nucleotide
	polymorphism effects in the reference population, and the method
	used to calculate the reliability. A common finding in 3 countries
	(United States, New Zealand, and Australia) was that a straightforward
	BLUP method for estimating the marker effects gave reliabilities
	of GEBV almost as high as more complex methods. The BLUP method is
	attractive because the only prior information required is the additive
	genetic variance of the trait. All countries included a polygenic
	effect (parent average breeding value) in their GEBV calculation.
	This inclusion is recommended to capture any genetic variance not
	associated with the markers, and to put some selection pressure on
	low-frequency QTL that may not be captured by the markers. The reliabilities
	of GEBV achieved were significantly greater than the reliability
	of parental average breeding values, the current criteria for selection
	of bull calves to enter progeny test teams. The increase in reliability
	is sufficiently high that at least 2 dairy breeding companies are
	already marketing bull teams for commercial use based on their GEBV
	only, at 2 yr of age. This strategy should at least double the rate
	of genetic gain in the dairy industry. Many challenges with genomic
	selection and its implementation remain, including increasing the
	accuracy of GEBV, integrating genomic information into national and
	international genetic evaluations, and managing long-term genetic
	gain.},

	average relationship matrix derived from pedigree with the realized
	relationship matrix in best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) of
	breeding values, the accuracy of the breeding values can be substantially
	increased, especially for individuals with no phenotype of their
	own. We further demonstrate that this method of predicting breeding
	values is exactly equivalent to the genomic selection methodology
	where the effects of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) contributing
	to variation in the trait are assumed to be normally distributed.
	The accuracy of breeding values predicted using the realized relationship
	matrix in the BLUP equations can be deterministically predicted for
	known family relationships, for example half sibs. The deterministic
	method uses the effective number of independently segregating loci
	controlling the phenotype that depends on the type of family relationship
	and the length of the genome. The accuracy of predicted breeding
	values depends on this number of effective loci, the family relationship
	and the number of phenotypic records. The deterministic prediction
	demonstrates that the accuracy of breeding values can approach unity
	if enough relatives are genotyped and phenotyped. For example, when
	1000 full sibs per family were genotyped and phenotyped, and the
	heritability of the trait was 0.5, the reliability of predicted genomic
	breeding values (GEBVs) for individuals in the same full sib family
	without phenotypes was 0.82. These results were verified by simulation.
	A deterministic prediction was also derived for random mating populations,
	where the effective population size is the key parameter determining
	the effective number of independently segregating loci. If the effective
	population size is large, a very large number of individuals must
	be genotyped and phenotyped in order to accurately predict breeding
	values for unphenotyped individuals from the same population. If
	the heritability of the trait is 0.3, and N(e)=100, approximately
	12474 individuals with genotypes and phenotypes are required in order
	to predict GEBVs of un-phenotyped individuals in the same population

  abstract = {Previous studies have enabled exact prediction of probabilities of
	identity-by-descent (IBD) in random-mating populations for a few
	loci (up to four or so), with extension to more using approximate
	regression methods. Here we present a precise predictor of multiple-locus
	IBD using simple formulas based on exact results for two loci. In
	particular, the probability of non-IBD X(ABC) at each of ordered
	loci A, B, and C can be well approximated by X(ABC) = X(AB)X(BC)/X(B)
	and generalizes to X(123...k) = X(12)X(23...)X(k)(-1,k)/X(k-2), where
	X is the probability of non-IBD at each locus. Predictions from this
	chain rule are very precise with population bottlenecks and migration,
	but are rather poorer in the presence of mutation. From these coefficients,
	the probabilities of multilocus IBD and non-IBD can also be computed
	for genomic regions as functions of population size, time, and map
	distances. An approximate but simple recurrence formula is also developed,
	which generally is less accurate than the chain rule but is more
	robust with mutation. Used together with the chain rule it leads
	to explicit equations for non-IBD in a region. The results can be
	applied to detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) by computing
	the probability of IBD at candidate loci in terms of identity-by-state
	at neighboring markers.},

  abstract = {Summary Although the expected relationship or proportion of genome
	shared by pairs of relatives can be obtained from their pedigrees,
	the actual quantities deviate as a consequence of Mendelian sampling
	and depend on the number of chromosomes and map length. Formulae
	have been published previously for the variance of actual relationship
	for a number of specific types of relatives but no general formula
	for non-inbred individuals is available. We provide here a unified
	framework that enables the variances for distant relatives to be
	easily computed, showing, for example, how the variance of sharing
	for great grandparentâ??great grandchild, great uncleâ??great nephew,
	half uncleâ??nephew and first cousins differ, even though they have
	the same expected relationship. Results are extended in order to
	include differences in map length between sexes, no recombination
	in males and sex linkage. We derive the magnitude of skew in the
	proportion shared, showing the skew becomes increasingly large the
	more distant the relationship. The results obtained for variation
	in actual relationship apply directly to the variation in actual
	inbreeding as both are functions of genomic coancestry, and we show
	how to partition the variation in actual inbreeding between and within
	families. Although the variance of actual relationship falls as individuals
	become more distant, its coefficient of variation rises, and so,
	exacerbated by the skewness, it becomes increasingly difficult to
	distinguish different pedigree relationships from the actual fraction
	of the genome shared.},

	more of the within-breed genetic variance when the trait was influenced
	by 50 QTL. The predictive power eroded as the number of QTL increased.
	Panels that composed the QTL and no other markers were able to account
	for 50\% or more genetic variance even with 500 QTL. Panels that
	included genomic markers as well as QTL had less predictive power
	as the number of markers on the panel was increased. Panels that
	excluded the QTL and relied on markers in linkage disequilibrium
	(LD) to predict QTL effects performed more poorly than marker panels
	with QTL. Real-life situations with 50K panels that excluded the
	QTL could account for no more than 20\% genetic variation for 50
	QTL and less than 10\% for 500 QTL. The difference between panels
	that included and excluded QTL indicates that the predictive ability
	of existing panels is limited by their LD. Training in PB to predict
	MB tended to be more predictive than training in MB to predict PB
	due to greater average levels of LD in PB than in MB populations.
	Improved across breed prediction of genomic merit will require panels

  abstract = {The evaluation of organoleptic quality of tomato fruit requires physical,
	chemical and sensory analyses, which are expensive and difficult
	to assess. Therefore, their practical use in phenotypic selection
	is difficult. In a previous study, the genetic control of several
	traits related to organoleptic quality of fresh-market tomato fruit
	was investigated. Five chromosome regions strongly involved in organoleptic
	quality attributes were then chosen to be introgressed into three
	different recipient lines through marker-assisted selection. A marker-assisted
	backcross (MABC) strategy was performed, as all the favorable alleles
	for quality traits were provided by the same parental tomato line,
	whose fruit weight (FW) and firmness were much lower than those of
	the lines commonly used to develop fresh market varieties. Three
	improved lines were obtained after three backcrossing and two selfing
	generations. The implementation of the MABC scheme is described.
	The three improved lines were crossed together and with the recipient
	lines in a half-diallel mating scheme, and the simultaneous effect
	of the five quantitative trait locus (QTL) regions was compared in
	different genetic backgrounds. Significant effects of the introgressed
	regions and of the genetic backgrounds were shown. Additive effects
	were detected for soluble solid and reducing sugar content in two
	genetic backgrounds. A partially dominant effect on titratable acidity
	was detected in only one genetic background. In contrast, additive
	to dominant unfavorable effects of the donor alleles were detected
	for FW and locule number in the three genetic backgrounds. Recessive
	QTL effects on firmness were only detected in the two firmest genetic
	backgrounds. Comparison of the hybrids in the half-diallel gave complementary
	information on the effects of: (1) the alleles at the selected regions,
	(2) the genetic backgrounds and (3) their interaction. Breeding efficiency
	strongly varied according to the recipient parent, and significant
	interactions between QTLs and genetic backgrounds were shown for
	all of the traits studied.},

	(REML) have been used as an attractive method for positioning of
	quantitative trait loci (QTL). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) information
	can be easily implemented in the covariance structure among QTL effects
	(e.g. genotype relationship matrix) and mapping resolution appears
	to be high. Because of the use of LD information, the covariance
	structure becomes much richer and denser compared to the use of linkage
	information alone. This makes an average information ( AI) REML algorithm
	based on mixed model equations and sparse matrix techniques less
	useful. In addition, (near-) singularity problems often occur with
	high marker densities, which is common in fine-mapping, causing numerical
	problems in AIREML based on mixed model equations. The present study
	investigates the direct use of the variance covariance matrix of
	all observations in AIREML for LD mapping with a general complex
	pedigree. The method presented is more efficient than the usual approach
	based on mixed model equations and robust to numerical problems caused
	by near- singularity due to closely linked markers. It is also feasible
	to fit multiple QTL simultaneously in the proposed method whereas

	We show that half sib designs that have often been used for linkage

	This results in bias and loss of information. One way to incorporate
	the genomic information into a full genetic evaluation is by modifying
	the numerator relationship matrix. A naive proposal is to substitute
	the relationships of genotyped animals with the genomic relationship
	matrix. However, this results in incoherencies because the genomic
	relationship matrix includes information on relationships among ancestors
	and descendants. In other words, using the pedigree-derived covariance
	between genotyped and ungenotyped individuals, with the pretense
	that genomic information does not exist, leads to inconsistencies.
	It is proposed to condition the genetic value of ungenotyped animals
	on the genetic value of genotyped animals via the selection index
	(e.g., pedigree information), and then use the genomic relationship
	matrix for the latter. This results in a joint distribution of genotyped
	and ungenotyped genetic values, with a pedigree-genomic relationship
	matrix H. In this matrix, genomic information is transmitted to the
	covariances among all ungenotyped individuals. The matrix is (semi)positive
	definite by construction, which is not the case for the naive approach.
	Numerical examples and alternative expressions are discussed. Matrix
	H is suitable for iteration on data algorithms that multiply a vector

	This work evaluated several computing options, including half-stored
	Cholesky decomposition, Gauss-Seidel, and 3 matrix-free strategies:
	Gauss-Seidel, Gauss-Seidel with residuals update, and preconditioned
	conjugate gradients. Matrix-free Gauss-Seidel with residuals update
	adjusts the residuals after computing the solution for each effect.
	This avoids adjusting the left-hand side of the equations by all
	other effects at every step of the algorithm and saves considerable
	computing time. Any Gauss-Seidel algorithm can easily be extended
	for variance component estimation by Markov chain-Monte Carlo. Let
	m and n be the number of records and markers, respectively. Computing

	times per round are proportional to mn2 in matrix-free Gauss-Seidel,

	than 1 h for half-stored Gauss-Seidel, 2 h for Cholesky decomposition,
	and 4 d for matrix-free Gauss-Seidel. Preconditioned conjugate gradients

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the availability of large-scale, high-density single-nucleotide
	polymorphism (SNP) markers, substantial effort has been made in identifying
	disease-causing genes using linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping by
	haplotype analysis of unrelated individuals. In addition to complex
	diseases, many continuously distributed quantitative traits are of
	primary clinical and health significance. However the development
	of association mapping methods using unrelated individuals for quantitative
	traits has received relatively less attention. RESULTS: We recently
	developed an association mapping method for complex diseases by mining
	the sharing of haplotype segments (i.e., phased genotype pairs) in
	affected individuals that are rarely present in normal individuals.
	In this paper, we extend our previous work to address the problem
	of quantitative trait mapping from unrelated individuals. The method
	is non-parametric in nature, and statistical significance can be
	obtained by a permutation test. It can also be incorporated into
	the one-way ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) framework so that other
	factors and covariates can be easily incorporated. The effectiveness
	of the approach is demonstrated by extensive experimental studies
	using both simulated and real data sets. The results show that our
	haplotype-based approach is more robust than two statistical methods
	based on single markers: a single SNP association test (SSA) and
	the Mann-Whitney U-test (MWU). The algorithm has been incorporated
	into our existing software package called HapMiner, which is available
	from our website at http://www.eecs.case.edu/~jxl175/HapMiner.html.
	CONCLUSION: For QTL (quantitative trait loci) fine mapping, to identify
	QTNs (quantitative trait nucleotides) with realistic effects (the
	contribution of each QTN less than 10\% of total variance of the
	trait), large samples sizes (>or= 500) are needed for all the methods.
	The overall performance of HapMiner is better than that of the other
	two methods. Its effectiveness further depends on other factors such
	as recombination rates and the density of typed SNPs. Haplotype-based
	methods might provide higher power than methods based on a single
	SNP when using tag SNPs selected from a small number of samples or
	some other sources (such as HapMap data). Rank-based statistics usually
	have much lower power, as shown in our study.},

  abstract = {Marker-assisted genetic evaluation needs to infer genotypes at quantitative
	trait loci (QTL) based on the information of linked markers. As the
	inference usually provides the probability distribution of QTL genotypes
	rather than a specific genotype, marker-assisted genetic evaluation
	is characterized by the mixture model because of the uncertainty
	of QTL genotypes. It is, therefore, necessary to develop a statistical
	procedure useful for mixture model analyses. In this study, a set
	of mixture model equations was derived based on the normal mixture
	model and the EM algorithm for evaluating linear models with uncertain
	independent variables. The derived equations can be seen as an extension
	of Henderson's mixed model equations to mixture models and provide
	a general framework to deal with the issues of uncertain incidence
	matrices in linear models. The mixture model equations were applied
	to marker-assisted genetic evaluation with different parameterizations
	of QTL effects. A sire-QTL-effect model and a founder-QTL-effect
	model were used to illustrate the application of the mixture model
	equations. The potential advantages of the mixture model equations
	for marker-assisted genetic evaluation were discussed. The mixed-effect
	mixture model equations are flexible in modelling QTL effects and
	show desirable properties in estimating QTL effects, compared with
	Henderson's mixed model equations.}

	Since the latter is usually on the order of 0.1-0.5 and since there

	on the case in which the relationships among the sampled individuals

	linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of allele frequency. We derive this

	for the fine mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) using a dense
	marker map. The method compares the expected covariances between
	haplotype effects given a postulated QTL position tu the covariances
	that are found in the data. The expected covariances between the
	haplotype effects are proportional to the probability that the QTL
	position is identical by descent (IBD) given the marker haplotype
	information, which is calculated using the genedropping method. Simulation
	results showed that a QTL was correctly positioned within a region
	of 3, 1.5, or 0.75 cM in 70, 62, and 68\%, respectively, of the replicates
	using markers spaced at intervals of 1, 0.5, and 0.25 cM, respectively.
	These results were rather insensitive to the number of generations
	since the QTL occurred and to the effective population size, except
	that 10 generations yielded rather poor estimates of the QTL position.
	The position estimates of this multimarker disequilibrium mapping
	method were more accurate than those from a single marker transmission
	disequilibrium test. A general approach for identifying QTL is suggested,
	where several stages of disequilibrium mapping are used with increasingly
	dense marker spacing.}

	when genomic predictions can be obtained by modifying the numerator
	relationship matrix A to H = A + A(Delta), where A(Delta) includes
	deviations from expected relationships. However, the traditional
	mixed model equations require H(-1), which is usually difficult to
	obtain for large pedigrees. The computations with H are feasible
	when the mixed model equations are expressed in an alternate form
	that also applies for singular H and when those equations are solved
	by the conjugate gradient techniques. Then the only computations
	involving H are in the form of Aq or A(Delta)q, where q is a vector.
	The alternative equations have a nonsymmetric left-hand side. Computing
	A(Delta)q is inexpensive when the number of nonzeros in A(Delta)
	is small, and the product Aq can be calculated efficiently in linear
	time using an indirect algorithm. Generalizations to more complicated
	models are proposed. The data included 10.2 million final scores
	on 6.2 million Holsteins and were analyzed by a repeatability model.
	Comparisons involved the regular and the alternative equations. The
	model for the second case included simulated A(Delta). Solutions
	were obtained by the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm,
	which works only with symmetric matrices, and by the bi-conjugate
	gradient stabilized algorithm, which also works with nonsymmetric
	matrices. The convergence rate associated with the nonsymmetric solvers
	was slightly better than that with the symmetric solver for the original
	equations, although the time per round was twice as much for the
	nonsymmetric solvers. The convergence rate associated with the alternative
	equations ranged from 2 times lower without A(Delta) to 3 times lower
	for the largest simulated A(Delta). When the information attributable
	to genomics can be expressed as modifications to the numerator relationship

	controlling phenotypic characters expressed in the early stage of
	development are highly conserved and that recent evolutionary changes
	have occurred primarily in the characters expressed in later stages
	of development. Even the genes controlling the latter characters
	are generally conserved, but there is a large component of neutral
	or nearly neutral genetic variation within and between closely related
	species. Phenotypic evolution occurs primarily by mutation of genes
	that interact with one another in the developmental process. The
	enormous amount of phenotypic diversity among different phyla or
	classes of organisms is a product of accumulation of novel mutations
	and their conservation that have facilitated adaptation to different
	environments. Novel mutations may be incorporated into the genome
	by natural selection (elimination of preexisting genotypes) or by
	random processes such as genetic and genomic drift. However, once
	the mutations are incorporated into the genome, they may generate
	developmental constraints that will affect the future direction of
	phenotypic evolution. It appears that the driving force of phenotypic
	evolution is mutation, and natural selection is of secondary importance.},

	for a dairy cattle breeding scheme by utilizing simulated data. Reliable
	estimates for variance components in QTL models are a prerequisite
	in fine-mapping experiments and for marker-assisted genetic evaluations.
	In cattle populations, only a small fraction of the population is
	genotyped at genetic markers, and only these animals are included
	in marker-assisted genetic evaluation models. Phenotypic information
	in these models are precorrected phenotypes [daughter yield deviations
	(DYD) for bulls, yield deviations (YD) for cows] estimated by standard
	animal models from the entire population. Because DYD and YD may
	represent different amounts of information, the problem of weighting
	these 2 types of information appropriately arises. To detect the
	best combination of phenotypes and weighting factors, a stochastic
	simulation for a trait representing milk yield was used. The results
	show that DYD models are generally optimal for estimating QTL variance
	components, but properties of estimates depend strongly on weighting
	factors. An example for the benefit in selection of using YD is shown
	for the selection among paternal half-sibs inheriting alternative
	QTL alleles. Even if QTL effects are small, marker-assisted best
	unbiased linear prediction can improve the selection among half-sibs,
	because the Mendelian sampling variance within family can be exploited,
	especially in DYD-YD models. Marker-assisted genetic evaluation models
	should also include YD for cows to ensure that marker-assisted selection
	improves selection even for moderate QTL effects (> or =10\%). A
	useful strategy for practical implementation is to estimate variance

	The following were observed for the deterministic method relative

	of IBD probabilities were found to agree closely, even though it
	does not extract information when haplotypes are not known with certainty;
	(iii) the shape of the profile for the QTL test statistic as a function

	was slightly smaller; and (iv) the estimates of QTL variance was
	similar. It was concluded that the method proposed provided a rapid

	(or deleted), or new epistatic interactions can be included between
	existing genetic factors. The method is illustrated with simulated
	and real data. AVAILABILITY: An executable version of the program

	Infinitesimal genetic effects or environmental noise ("fixed") effects
	can equally be fitted. A diallelic QTL is assumed and both additive
	and dominant effects can be estimated. We have implemented a combined
	Gibbs/Metropolis-Hastings sampling to obtain the marginal posterior
	distributions of the parameters of interest. We have also implemented
	a Bayesian variant of usual disequilibrium measures like D' and r(2)
	between QTL and markers. We illustrate the method with simulated
	data in "simple" (two-generation full-sib families) and "complex"
	(four-generation) pedigrees. We compared the estimates with and without
	using linkage disequilibrium information. In general, using LDL resulted
	in estimates of QTL position that were much better than linkage-only
	estimates when there was complete disequilibrium between the mutant
	QTL allele and the marker. This advantage, however, decreased when
	the association was only partial. In all cases, additive and dominant

	a basis for maximum-likelihood estimation of either the recombination
	rate, the mutation rate, or the age of the allele, provided that
	the two other parameters are known. This theory is applied to (1)
	the data of Hastbacka et al., to estimate the recombination rate
	between a locus associated with diastrophic dysplasia and a linked
	RFLP marker; (2) the data of Risch et al., to estimate the age of

	rates and that those estimates are not very sensitive to parameters,
	such as the population age, whose values are not known with certainty.
	In contrast, we also conclude that, in many cases, linkage disequilibrium
	may not lead to useful estimates of allele age, because of the relatively

	All bulls were genotyped for 32 genetic markers on chromosome 14,

	effect on fat percentage. In GS, the data were analyzed with a multiple
	quantitative trait loci (QTL) model with haplotype effects for each
	marker bracket and a polygenic effect. Identical-by-descent probabilities
	based on linkage and linkage disequilibrium information were used
	to model the covariances between haplotypes. A Bayesian method using
	Gibbs sampling was used to predict the presence of a putative QTL
	and the effects of the haplotypes in each marker bracket. In BLUP,
	the haplotype effects were removed from the model, whereas in GEN,
	the haplotype effects were replaced by the effect of the genotype
	at the known causative mutation. The breeding values from the national
	genetic evaluation were treated as true breeding values because of
	their high accuracy and were used to compute the accuracy of prediction
	for GS, BLUP, and GEN. The allele substitution effect for the causative
	mutation, obtained from GEN, was 0.35\% fat. The accuracy of the
	predicted breeding values for GS (0.75) was as high as for GEN (0.75)
	and higher than for BLUP (0.51). When some markers close to the QTL
	were omitted from the model, the accuracy of prediction was only
	slightly lower, around 0.72. The removal of all markers within 8
	cM from the QTL reduced the accuracy to 0.64, which was still much
	higher than BLUP. It is concluded that, when applied to 1 chromosome
	and if genetic markers close to the QTL are available, the presented
	model for GS is as accurate as GEN.},

	we demonstrate that the motif harboring OPN3907, which is upstream

	osteopontin regulatory elements, is moderately conserved among mammals.
	The motif was not retrieved from database queries and may be a novel

	HapMap project or resequencing data in a candidate region of interest)
	with genotype data at tag SNPs collected on a phenotyped study sample,
	to estimate ("impute") unmeasured genotypes, and then assess association
	between the phenotype and these estimated genotypes. Compared with
	standard single-SNP tests, this approach results in increased power
	to detect association, even in cases in which the causal variant
	is typed, with the greatest gain occurring when multiple causal variants
	are present. It also provides more interpretable explanations for
	observed associations, including assessing, for each SNP, the strength
	of the evidence that it (rather than another correlated SNP) is causal.
	Although we focus on association studies with quantitative phenotype
	and a relatively restricted region (e.g., a candidate gene), the

  abstract = {The information provided by dense genome-wide markers using high throughput
	technology is of considerable potential in human disease studies
	and livestock breeding programs. Genome-wide association studies
	relate individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from dense
	SNP panels to individual measurements of complex traits, with the
	underlying assumption being that any association is caused by linkage
	disequilibrium (LD) between SNP and quantitative trait loci (QTL)
	affecting the trait. Often SNP are in genomic regions of no trait
	variation. Whole genome Bayesian models are an effective way of incorporating
	this and other important prior information into modelling. However
	a full Bayesian analysis is often not feasible due to the large computational
	time involved.This article proposes an expectation-maximization (EM)
	algorithm called emBayesB which allows only a proportion of SNP to
	be in LD with QTL and incorporates prior information about the distribution
	of SNP effects. The posterior probability of being in LD with at
	least one QTL is calculated for each SNP along with estimates of
	the hyperparameters for the mixture prior. A simulated example of
	genomic selection from an international workshop is used to demonstrate
	the features of the EM algorithm. The accuracy of prediction is comparable
	to a full Bayesian analysis but the EM algorithm is considerably
	faster. The EM algorithm was accurate in locating QTL which explained
	more than 1\% of the total genetic variation. A computational algorithm
	for very large SNP panels is described.emBayesB is a fast and accurate
	EM algorithm for implementing genomic selection and predicting complex
	traits by mapping QTL in genome-wide dense SNP marker data. Its accuracy
	is similar to Bayesian methods but it takes only a fraction of the

  pages = {25},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT:Genomic data are used in animal breeding to assist genetic
	evaluation. Several models to estimate genomic breeding values have
	been studied. In general, two approaches have been used. One approach
	estimates the marker effects first and then, genomic breeding values
	are obtained by summing marker effects. In the second approach, genomic
	breeding values are estimated directly using an equivalent model
	with a genomic relationship matrix. Allele coding is the method chosen
	to assign values to the regression coefficients in the statistical
	model. A common allele coding is zero for the homozygous genotype
	of the first allele, one for the heterozygote, and two for the homozygous
	genotype for the other allele. Another common allele coding changes
	these regression coefficients by subtracting a value from each marker
	such that the mean of regression coefficients is zero within each
	marker. We call this centered allele coding. This study considered
	effects of different allele coding methods on inference. Both marker-based
	and equivalent models were considered, and restricted maximum likelihood
	and Bayesian methods were used in inference.Theoretical derivations
	showed that parameter estimates and estimated marker effects in marker-based
	models are the same irrespective of the allele coding, provided that
	the model has a fixed general mean. For the equivalent models, the
	same results hold, even though different allele coding methods lead
	to different genomic relationship matrices. Calculated genomic breeding
	values are independent of allele coding when the estimate of the
	general mean is included into the values. Reliabilities of estimated
	genomic breeding values calculated using elements of the inverse
	of the coefficient matrix depend on the allele coding because different
	allele coding methods imply different models. Finally, allele coding
	affects the mixing of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, with the
	centered coding being the best.Different allele coding methods lead
	to the same inference in the marker-based and equivalent models when
	a fixed general mean is included in the model. However, reliabilities
	of genomic breeding values are affected by the allele coding method
	used. The centered coding has some numerical advantages when Markov
	chain Monte Carlo methods are used.},

	choice, whereby the coefficient matrix is not stored but recreated
	as needed. In contrast, genomic prediction involves assessment of
	the merit of genome fragments characterized by single nucleotide
	polymorphism genotypes, currently some 50,000, which can then be
	used to predict the merit of individual animals according to the
	fragments they have inherited. The prediction equations for chromosome
	fragments typically have fewer than 100,000 unknowns, but the number
	of observations used to predict the fragment effects can be one-tenth
	the number of fragments. The coefficient matrix tends to be dense
	and the resulting system of equations can be ill behaved. Equivalent
	computing algorithms for genomic prediction were derived. The number

	animals, usually bulls, rather than the number of chromosome fragment
	effects. In circumstances with fewer genotyped animals than single
	nucleotide polymorphism genotypes, these equivalent computations
	allow the solving of a smaller system of equations that behaves numerically
	better. There were 3 solving strategies compared: 1 method that formed

	on Bos taurus autosome 6 (BTA6) for milk production traits in the
	German Holstein dairy cattle population. The analyzed chromosomal
	region on BTA6 spanned approximately 70 cM, and contained 6 microsatellite
	markers. Milk production data were obtained from routine genetic
	evaluation for 4500 genotyped German Holstein bulls. Technical aspects
	related to the estimation of model parameters for a large data set
	from routine genotype recording were outlined. A fixed QTL model
	and a random QTL model were introduced to incorporate marker information
	into parameter estimation and genetic evaluation. Estimated QTL variances,
	expressed as the ratio of QTL to polygenic variances, were 0.04,
	0.03, and 0.07 for milk yield; 0.06, 0.08, and 0.14 for fat yield;
	and 0.04, 0.04, and 0.11 for protein yield, in the first 3 parities,
	respectively. The estimated QTL positions, expressed as distances
	from the leftmost marker DIK82, were 18, 31, and 17 cM for milk yield;
	25, 17, and 9 cM for fat yield; and 16, 30, and 17 cM for protein
	yield in the 3 respective parities. Because the data for the parameter
	estimation well represented the current population of active German
	Holstein bulls, the QTL parameter estimates have been used in routine
	marker-assisted genetic evaluation for German Holsteins.}

	as the number of markers considered jointly increases in a multipoint
	test for linkage disequilibrium, while maintaining high power. Properties

	the signal from the untyped markers in a genome-wide association
	study. The central dogma can be summarized by the argument that if
	a marker is in tight LD with a polymorphism that directly impacts
	disease risk, as measured by the metric r(2), then one would be able
	to detect an association between the marker and disease with sample
	size that was increased by a factor of 1/r(2) over that needed to
	detect the effect of the functional variant directly. This 'fundamental

	of each other, that they are statistically independent of all other
	etiological factors ( in exposure and action), that sampling is prospective,
	and that the estimates of r(2) are accurate. None of these are standard

	markers with 2, 4, 6, 8 or 12 alleles. Several missing marker data
	patterns were considered. The genetic variability explained by marked
	quantitative trait loci ( MQTL) was modeled with one or two MQTL

	Method B were compared with that obtained by MABLUP using the exact
	genetic variance covariance matrix, which was estimated using 15

  abstract = {The study of continuously varying, quantitative traits is important
	in evolutionary biology, agriculture, and medicine. Variation in
	such traits is attributable to many, possibly interacting, genes
	whose expression may be sensitive to the environment, which makes
	their dissection into underlying causative factors difficult. An
	important population parameter for quantitative traits is heritability,
	the proportion of total variance that is due to genetic factors.
	Response to artificial and natural selection and the degree of resemblance
	between relatives are all a function of this parameter. Following
	the classic paper by R. A. Fisher in 1918, the estimation of additive
	and dominance genetic variance and heritability in populations is
	based upon the expected proportion of genes shared between different
	types of relatives, and explicit, often controversial and untestable
	models of genetic and non-genetic causes of family resemblance. With
	genome-wide coverage of genetic markers it is now possible to estimate
	such parameters solely within families using the actual degree of
	identity-by-descent sharing between relatives. Using genome scans
	on 4,401 quasi-independent sib pairs of which 3,375 pairs had phenotypes,
	we estimated the heritability of height from empirical genome-wide
	identity-by-descent sharing, which varied from 0.374 to 0.617 (mean
	0.498, standard deviation 0.036). The variance in identity-by-descent
	sharing per chromosome and per genome was consistent with theory.
	The maximum likelihood estimate of the heritability for height was
	0.80 with no evidence for non-genetic causes of sib resemblance,
	consistent with results from independent twin and family studies
	but using an entirely separate source of information. Our application
	shows that it is feasible to estimate genetic variance solely from
	within-family segregation and provides an independent validation
	of previously untestable assumptions. Given sufficient data, our
	new paradigm will allow the estimation of genetic variation for disease
	susceptibility and quantitative traits that is free from confounding
	with non-genetic factors and will allow partitioning of genetic variation
	into additive and non-additive components.},

  abstract = {Height has been used for more than a century as a model by which to
	understand quantitative genetic variation in humans. We report that
	the entire genome appears to contribute to its additive genetic variance.
	We used genotypes and phenotypes of 11,214 sibling pairs from three
	countries to partition additive genetic variance across the genome.
	Using genome scans to estimate the proportion of the genomes of each
	chromosome from siblings that were identical by descent, we estimated
	the heritability of height contributed by each of the 22 autosomes
	and the X chromosome. We show that additive genetic variance is spread
	across multiple chromosomes and that at least six chromosomes (i.e.,
	3, 4, 8, 15, 17, and 18) are responsible for the observed variation.
	Indeed, the data are not inconsistent with a uniform spread of trait
	loci throughout the genome. Our estimate of the variance explained
	by a chromosome is correlated with the number of times suggestive
	or significant linkage with height has been reported for that chromosome.
	Variance due to dominance was not significant but was difficult to
	assess because of the high sampling correlation between additive
	and dominance components. Results were consistent with the absence
	of any large between{hyphen}chromosome epistatic effects. Notwithstanding
	the proposed architecture of complex traits that involves widespread
	gene{hyphen}gene and gene{hyphen}environment interactions, our results
	suggest that variation in height in humans can be explained by many
	loci distributed over all autosomes, with an additive mode of gene
	action.},

	(GEBV) originates both from associations between high-density markers
	and QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) and from pedigree information.
	Thus, GEBV are expected to provide more persistent accuracy over
	successive generations than breeding values estimated using pedigree-based
	methods. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy
	of GEBV in a closed population of layer chickens and to quantify
	their persistence over five successive generations using marker or
	pedigree information.The training data consisted of 16 traits and
	777 genotyped animals from two generations of a brown-egg layer breeding
	line, 295 of which had individual phenotype records, while others
	had phenotypes on 2,738 non-genotyped relatives, or similar data
	accumulated over up to five generations. Validation data included
	phenotyped and genotyped birds from five subsequent generations (on
	average 306 birds/generation). Birds were genotyped for 23,356 segregating
	SNP. Animal models using genomic or pedigree relationship matrices
	and Bayesian model averaging methods were used for training analyses.
	Accuracy was evaluated as the correlation between EBV and phenotype
